The classification and recognition of type on the basis of individual features and
behaviors constitute a
preliminary measure and is an important target in the
behavioral sciences. Current statistical methods do not always yield satisfactory
answers. The Artificial Neural Network is the computer model inspired by the
structure of the Human Brain. It views as i
n the set of artificial nerve cells that are
interconnected with the other neurons. The primary aim of this project is to
demonstrate the process of developing Artificial Neural Networks based classifiers
using the Iris database. The problem concerns the i
dentification of Iris plant
species on the basis of plant attribute measurements. Neural networks are
implemented towards the identification of Iris plants on the basis of the following
measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width
. In this
research, Several
different Artificial Neural Networks
models
with diverse
architecture
are designed and compared
and
also different ratio of train and
validation data and learning rate are implemented on Iris data set to compare and
find the bes
t value.
The accuracy of %100 is achieved by setting the optimum
value of hyper
parameters using cross validation methods.
